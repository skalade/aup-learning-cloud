# O3DE renders through Vulkan, which needs a presentable surface: Xvfb can't
# provide one (no DRI3, so only the llvmpipe software device is presentable),
# but Xwayland on a headless Weston compositor can - it hands the X server the
# real /dev/dri render node, so the iGPU does the rendering. The simulation
# camera is then republished as MJPEG by web_video_server and shown next to the
# agent chat in the Streamlit page, so the whole demo lives in the browser.
