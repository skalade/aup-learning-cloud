# The notebook drives CaP-X through the framework's own API: LaunchArgs,
# _load_config, _start_api_servers, instantiate, ModelQueryArgs, query_model and
# env.step. Reading those calls is the point of the notebook, so what lives here
# is only what would bury them - the process setup a Jupyter kernel does not
# inherit, the Lemonade bring-up that notebooks 02 and 03 already covered, and
# the frame-by-frame video and artifact plumbing around a run.
